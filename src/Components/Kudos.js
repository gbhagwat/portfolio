                            I worked alongside Gabrielle for three years while at
                            CACI and she never failed to impress me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Gabrielle was an amazing person to work with, fun, hard
                            working, always learning, and most importantly:
                            extremely talented. She always had the ability to
                            complete a project under even the toughest
                            circumstances, always delivering above-and-beyond;
                            impressing the customer consistently.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With a natural talent for design, user experience (UX),
                            user interface (UI) design and development, she is
                            always challenging the "why" from the user's perspective
                            and offers creative solutions that not only make the
                            interface easier and less cumbersome, but look and feel
                            just as good. Her ability to work within and learn
                            various codebases/frameworks--sometimes
                            concurrently--quite seamlessly is simply the icing on
                            the cake.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I couldn't recommend Gabrielle more highly. Her raw
                            talent coupled with her ability--and eagerness--to learn
                            and grow doesn't come along everyday.

                        Gabrielle is a growth mindset force to be reckoned with.
                        If she doesn’t know something (and she knows a lot!), she
                        gets scrappy and goes to great lengths to figure it out.
                        She’s got a relentless can-do attitude and really cares a
                        lot about the work she’s doing, and especially the
                        outcomes for the business and the users. She’s thoughtful,
                        but damn is she efficient!

                            I hired Gabrielle as a UX/UI Designer at CACI and
                            managed her for several years. I was impressed by her
                            experience and her experience proved to be invaluable.
                            She comes highly recommended.

                        <p>
                            Her enthusiasm, flexibility and natural talent made her
                            a solid asset to our team. It didn’t take long for her
                            to ramp up. Gabrielle is a fast learner - she was quick
                            to adapt to our design process and to become quite
                            proficient in JavaScript.

                        <p>
                            Gabrielle not only has the chops to design and develop
                            stunning sites, but she has the skills and expertise to
                            craft compelling user experiences. Her background and
                            passion for UX shined through in everything she did. .

                            Gabrielle was excellent in UI and web page design and
                            development. Her coding was skillful, her designs were
                            unique and innovative, so clients were always happy.
