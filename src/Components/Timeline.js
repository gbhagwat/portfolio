                I fell in love with <em>all things web</em> when I was introduced
                to â€œthe internet". The technology, design and sense of community behind the internet was magical in itself.  As I was teaching myself HTML on my Gateway computer in high school, I dreamt of becoming a Disney Imagineer and designing stellar sites for the most magical place on earth, Disney World.

                During college, I started my first internship at Sherwin-Williams
                Corporate Headquarters as a Web Analyst Co-op.  Thanks to my internship, I got the opportunity to attend an IAI (Information Architecture Institute) Conference at Progressive Insurance.
                That's where I had my 'aha' moment that I wanted to devote my
                career to helping users interact with technology.

              <p>
                My first <abbr title="Information Architecture">IA</abbr> project was the redesign of the Corporate HR Employee Benefits site. With the redesign and development of the site, I seized the opportunity to teach myself CSS.

                In 2008, after a recruiter asked me if I knew how to use a camera and PowerPoint, my career as a Technical Writer began as a fluke at
                Fluke Biomedical. Pursuing the career path seemed logical and I was eventually recruited by Philips Healthcare and Nelson Stud
                Welding.
              </p>
              <p>
                I gained valuable UX skills as a Technical Writer - empathy for
                the users of my products, knowing the right questions to ask,
                learning to simplify and create visuals for complex concepts.

                I worked full-time throughout my college years as I pursued my
                Bachelors of Arts in Communications at Cleveland State University
                (2009) and Masters of Science, IAKM (Information Architecture and Knowledge Management), User Experience Design, at
                Kent State University (2014).

              </p>
              <p>
                I individualized my coursework to support a breadth of knowledge and perspective across several disciplines - business, communications, design, research, technology and psychology - to complement my anticipated Masters degree.

              <p>
                I moved from Ohio to Northern Virginia after getting my first role
                as a UX/UI Designer at CACI International.
              </p>
              <p>In my first 6 years at Media Services Center, I served a variety of roles - Accessibility SME, Lead Designer and Designer/Developer - advocating for the user on 20+ projects including employee sites and mission critical apps. I taught myself JavaScript to support my development projects.
              </p>
              <p>Upon returning from maternity leave in 2021, I realized I was ready to move on, I landed a UX Designer role on the AMOD program, where I was quickly promoted to Team Lead - driving Accessibility and Design System initiatives. Unfortunately, CACI lost the contract in April 2022.
              </p>
              <p>Upon redeployment at CACI, I took a Front-End Developer role as a great opportunity to gain modern front-end frameworks experience. Since polishing the UI on the newest app, I've been advocating for a design system - consistency in the UI - across all apps.

              <p>
                I've realized I want to return my focus to design and land the job in an organization that values UX design as I imagined when I graduated from my Masters program.
              </p>
              <p>I'm ready for the next chapter - the ideal rewarding role which will provide me the resources to build a better UX while contributing to the greater good.
